# code-refactor
Targed was to symplify CSS file and HTML. Make it structured to follow semantic HTML.

 * Rename Div to Main, Aside, Footer and Header.

 * Remove identical items
   Identify and remove the same classes which included the same parameters (as text, colors etc.)

 * Add accessible alt attributes to all images (explane the image content).

 * Assign ID for to links to bring user to correct section of page.
 
 * Make CSS file clear to follow semantic structure and add comment to it.

## Screenshot
 I used inpect to find which setting doesn't work for each element. That helps a lot to identify the same setting for elements
